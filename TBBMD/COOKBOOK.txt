TWAS-pipeline CookBook

The analysis consists of weight generation from PLINK map/ped files and expression phenotypes
using TWAS_get_weights.sh, to be followed by imputation given z-score from a GWAS.

An example is provided here for total body bone mineral density (TBBMD) analysis and ALG5 
is used here for illustration.

ALG5.map and ALG5.map were generated via the following command,

    plink2 --bed /gen_omics/data/EPIC-Norfolk/plink/chr$1.bed \
           --bim /gen_omics/data/EPIC-Norfolk/plink/chr$1.bim \
           --fam EPICNorfolk.fam \
           --keep bmd.id \
           --extract ALG5 \
           --recode \
           --out ALG5

where ALG5 contains RSid and bmd.id individuals with non-missing phenotype, respectively.

Now we run

   TWAS_get_weights.sh ALG5 twas/ALG5

to obtain ALG5.cor, ALG5.ld and ALG5.map in bmd/twas,

We have ALG5-specific zscore, generated with command

    echo "SNP_ID SNP_Pos Ref_Allele Alt_Allele Z-score" > ALG5.zscore
    sort -k2,2 /gen_omics/data/3-2012/genes/ALG5 > ALG5
    join -j 2 bmd-$1.zscore ALG5 | awk '{t=$1; $1=$2; $2=t; $NF=""; print}'>> ALG5.zscore

   
so as to obtain ALG5.imp from command

   TWAS.sh twas/ALG5 ALG5.zscore twas/ALG5

A command file, bmd-twas.sh, is provided which can be executed to conduct these steps for
individual chromosomes, e.g., sh twas.sh 1, for chromosome 1, sh twas.sh 2, for 
chromosome 2, etc.

To accommodate possible changes in RS ids, bmd-twas2.sh is also created based on the
chromosomal positions. It is also desirable that the analysis is by short lists
of geens than chromosomes and therefore computationally efficient when propagate 
under clusters.

At times it is desirable to run imputation for a particular gene while keeping all
intermediate files, which can be done via bmd-1.sh for a given gene.
