TWAS-pipeline CookBook

The analysis contains five steps:

1. Obtain meta-analysis results on RSid, position, effect/other alleles, and z-score.
2. Prepare for gene-specific PLINK map/ped files.
3. Generate weights using TWAS_get_weights.sh and data from step 2.
4. Select gene-specific z-scores.
5. Conduct imputation according to weights from step 3 and z-score from step 4.


Example

An example is provided here for total body bone mineral density (TBBMD) analysis and ALG5 
is used here for illustration. In reality, we will need expression data for steps 1 and 2.

1. These are files in directory bmd called bmd-1.txt, ..., bmd-22.txt
2. For ALG5, ALG5.map and ALG5.map were generated via the following command,

    plink2 --bed /gen_omics/data/EPIC-Norfolk/plink/chr$1.bed \
           --bim /gen_omics/data/EPIC-Norfolk/plink/chr$1.bim \
           --fam EPICNorfolk.fam \
           --keep bmd.id \
           --extract ALG5 \
           --recode \
           --out ALG5

    where ALG5 contains RSid and bmd.id individuals with non-missing phenotype, respectively.

3. These are ALG5.cor, ALG5.ld and ALG5.map in bmd/twas, which were generated with 
   command 

   TWAS_get_weights.sh ALG5 twas/ALG5

4. This file is ALG5.zscore, generated with command

    echo "SNP_ID SNP_Pos Ref_Allele Alt_Allele Z-score" > ALG5.zscore
    sort -k2,2 /gen_omics/data/3-2012/genes/ALG5 > ALG5
    join -j 2 bmd-$1.zscore ALG5 | awk '{t=$1; $1=$2; $2=t; $NF=""; print}'>> ALG5.zscore

5. This is ALG5.imp, in bmd/twas, generated from command

   TWAS.sh twas/ALG5 ALG5.zscore twas/ALG5

A command file, bmd-twas.sh, is provided which can be executed to conduct steps 2-5 for
individual chromosomes, e.g., sh twas.sh 1, for chromosome 1, sh twas.sh 2, for 
chromosome 2, etc.

To accommodate possible changes in RS ids, bmd-twas2.sh is also created based on the
chromosomal positions. It is also desirable that the analysis is by short lists
of geens than chromosomes and therefore computationally efficient when propagate 
under clusters.

At times it is desirable to run imputation for a particular gene while keeping all
intermediate files, which can be done via 1.sh for a given gene.
